\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

At the LHC, the precision determination of the parton distributions of the proton is an important
ingredient for many analysis, from Higgs boson characterization to New Physics searches
and precision Standard Model measurements.
%
In addition to the proton-proton program, the LHC is also running a very exciting program proton-lead
and lead-lead collisions.
%
The main physics goals of this program is to understand the quark-gluon plasma
created in the hot and dense collisions, as well as to characterize the initial
state of cold nuclear matter.
%
To carry out this program, the determination of the the modifications of the PDFs of
nucleons inside a lead nucleus is of paramount importance.

Nuclear parton distributions are determined mostly from neutral-current and charged-current
deep-inelastic structure functions on nuclear targets.
%
In addition, data from other experiments like Drell-Yan production at RHIC provide additional
information.
%
Various groups provide public sets of nuclear parton distributions, such as
EPS09~\cite{Eskola:2009uj},
DSSZ08~\cite{deFlorian:2011fp}.
%
Since the experimental information on nuclear collisions is much more scarce than the the proton
case, nuclear PDF uncertainties are affected by substantial uncertainties.




In a series of
papers~\cite{Forte:2002fg,DelDebbio:2004qj,DelDebbio:2007ee,Ball:2008by,Rojo:2008ke,Ball:2009mk,Ball:2009qv,Ball:2010de,Ball:2011mu,Ball:2011uy,Ball:2012cx},
the NNPDF collaboration 
has introduced a methodology aimed at reducing as much as possible
this procedural uncertainty.

As a byproduct of this work, we present for the first time a nuclear PDF fit at NNLO, accounting for
heavy quark mass effects using the FONLL general-mass scheme.
%
Although both NNLO effects and heavy quark mass effects are presumably smaller than current
experimental uncertainties, it does not cost anything to do a proper job since we
have all the machinery ready.

Now we want to apply it to the case of nuclear PDFs ....

There are two main motivations to provide a set of lead PDFs using the NNPDF framework.
%
First one
%
Second, it provides a suitable starting point to study the impact of LHC $pPb$ into the lead
nuclear PDFs, using for example the Bayesian reweighting technique~\cite{Ball:2011gg,Ball:2010gb}.
%
A large number of observables in $pPb$ collisions have been advocated to reduce the
large uncertainties in nuclear PDFs including low mass Drell-Yan and inclusive
hadroproduction~\cite{Armesto:2013kqa}, dijet production~\cite{Paukkunen:2014pha,Eskola:2013aya},
isolated photon production~\cite{Helenius:2014qla} or even top quark
pair producition~\cite{d'Enterria:2015jna}
%
Some of these measurements have already become available at Run I, and more will be so
at the upcoming Run II heavy ion program.
%
The availability of nNNPDFs thus provides an alternative method to quantify the impact
of available LHC $pPb$ measurements.
